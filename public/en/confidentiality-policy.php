		<h1>CONFIDENTIALITY POLICY</h1>
		<h2>Strictly Between You and Us</h2>
		<p>At National Bank Insurance<sup>1</sup>, your privacy is a priority. As such, we have always taken the utmost care to safeguard your personal information.</p>
		<p>We have developed confidentiality policies and procedures to protect your personal information and thereby ensure that your privacy rights are fully respected. Our commitment to privacy is an integral part of our Code of Professional Conduct, which our employees are required to follow as a condition of employment.</p>
		<p>You may contact the Personal Information Access Officer at the following address:</p>
		<h3>National Bank Life Insurance Company<br />1100 University, 5th Floor<br />Montreal, Quebec<br />H3B 2G7</h3><br />
		<em>1. Refers to National Bank Insurance and National Bank Life Insurance Company whose agents and employees promote and sell insurance products under the National Bank Insurance name.</em>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>A matter of service</h2>
		<p>In order for us to provide you with the products and services you want, we need a minimum amount of personal information. Most of that information comes from you. For example, when filling out an Enrollment Form, we ask for your name, address and telephone number. In certain situations, collection of your personal information on may be done by one of our service providers, on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other insurers or information agencies when settling your claims.</p>
		<p>In most cases, your consent is recorded by our automated call recording system or on the quotation request form. It may also be recorded in your claims file.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>A matter of identification</h2>
		<p>We may need your social insurance number when, for example, the information in our possession at the time a quotation is requested is not sufficient to obtain the necessary information from the credit bureaus that we consult to determine your eligibility for products and services. While you can always refuse to give us your social insurance number, we believe that in some cases, it can help us differentiate you from other clients with the same name.</p>
		<hr />
        
		<h2>A matter of choice</h2>
		<p>We also obtain your consent to propose products and services, through telemarketing<sup>1</sup> or otherwise, that might interest you or suit your needs. The consent you provide for this purpose has precedence over the National Do Not Call List.<sup>2</sup> If at some point you decide that you no longer wish to be informed about the products and services offered by National Bank Life Insurance Company, you can contact our Customer Service Department and your name will be removed from the list that we prepare for this purpose. Your choice will have no effect on the service you receive. If you choose to have your name removed from the list, you will still receive the messages that are normally sent from time to time with your renewal notices or other communications relating to your insurance contract, and our staff will continue to personally provide information to you on our products and services.</p>
		<em>1. Telemarketing consists in using telecommunication installations to make non-solicited telephone calls or send non-solocited faxes to consumers for solicitation purposes.</em><br />
		<em>2. For further information about the National Do Not Call List, go to <a href="http://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/">http://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca/</a> or call <strong>1 866 580-3625</strong>.</em>

		<h2>A matter of compliance</h2>
		<h3>If required to serve you</h3>
		<p>Certain activities, such as one-to-one communications, are conducted through outside suppliers. In some case, those suppliers may be established in the United States. When applicable, these suppliers will only have access to the information they need to provide the service. We require a formal commitment from them to respect the confidentiality of any such information. If you have questions concerning the services rendered by our suppliers or the countries from which they may have access to your personal information for the purposes explained herein, please contact the Privacy agent at the above-mentioned address.</p>
		<h3>If required by law</h3>
		<p>National Bank Insurance is legally required to disclose information about you when it or one of its service providers receives a valid request, search warrant, subpoena or other government or court order. Such requests may come from Canadian or foreign – in particular, American – authorities.</p>

In such situations, if we have conveyed incorrect information to third parties, we will do everything possible to bring the corrections to their attention. Finally, if you fail to notify us of a change, you will, unfortunately, have to assume the consequences and will not be able to hold us liable for any damages you may incur.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>A matter of security</h2>
		<p>We take precaution to protect your information against loss, destruction and theft, and to safeguard it against unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which it is held or where it is found. Various safeguards have been put in place, including:</p>
		<ul>

			<li><strong>Technical safeguards :</strong> aimed at maintaining a highly secure technological environment.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h2>A matter of retention and destruction</h2>
		<p>As your personal information is retained for as long as is necessary to provide the service for which it is collected, the retention period depends on the product or service. If you stop doing business with us, we may keep some information in order to comply with the law, settle future transactions or look up past transactions. When such information is no longer necessary, it is destroyed. When destroying personal information, we follow strict procedures and take steps to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to it.</p>
